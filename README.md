# Tauri Hello world

My first taste of coss-platform developmemnt tool **Tauri**. Built on react.

## 1. Tauri dev

Open tauri dev mode:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

## 2. Tauri build

Build exectuable binary based on your operation system. There is no corss-platform compiling yet.

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

## 3. Origional React Project
